# social_media_analytics

This repository gives insight into API communication with different social media platforms, and gives examples of analyzing the data for different use cases.

Scraping highly viral content can be very useful e.g. for content creators who want to react to certain videos, but there are many other use cases as well.
To use the code and interact with the social media channels, it is necessary to get your own API connection variables. 
E.G. instagram is using the meta graph API which requires variables such as 'access_token', 'client_id', 'client_secret'.
